## User Tweets

Simple boilerplate to replicate a tweet collecting webapp with Drake's “Nothing was the same” album cover image.

I developed this for a friend, so please don't take this _too_ seriously.


### Instructions

* Clone repo
* Install requirements
* Install MongoDB (or use a hosted service)
* Create a specific app on the twitter dev site, and generate appropriate tokens
* Set string values into scripts/setting
* Configure username in index.tpl file
* Run wuth `python app.py`
